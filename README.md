# Hangman

Game of Hangman made in Visual Studio. I had to stay home because of a cough so I made this.

If you want to run it, use VS 2019 (I don't no if it wil run in other versions)
Just push Open with Visual Studio, then clone the GitHub repository in Visual Studio to a path on your computer and then you can start the program.

If you want to add words chang string[] randomWords = { "ghello" }; to string[] randomWords = { "yourword" , "yourword2" }; etc.
