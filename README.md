# Hangman

Game of Hangman made in Visual Studio. I had to stay home because of a cough so I made this.

If you want to run it, use VS 2019 (I don't no if it wil run in other versions)
\
Just hit Open with Visual Studio, then clone the GitHub repository in Visual Studio to a path on your computer and then you can start the program with the green button at the top.

If you want to add words change "string[] randomWords = { "ghello" };" in "program.cs" to "string[] randomWords = { "yourword" , "yourword2" };" etc.
